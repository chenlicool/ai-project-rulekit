# Post-Task Documentation Sync Workflow

After any substantive change, documentation must be synced.

## Required Order
1. Impact Analysis
2. Update `MEMORY.md` (include Impact Analysis and result)
3. Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` if needed
4. Update `README.md` / `API.md` if needed
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md`

## Version Alignment
- If a `package.json` or other version file exists, keep it consistent with `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Ordering Rule
- `MEMORY.md` must be maintained in reverse chronological order with newest first.
